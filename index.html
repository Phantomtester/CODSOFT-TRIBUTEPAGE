            <h3 class="about1">ABOUT</h3>
            <p>Nikola Tesla: <b>(10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943)</b> was a 
                Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for 
                his contributions to the design of the modern<b> alternating current (AC) electricity supply system</b>.<br>
                Born and raised in the <b>Austrian Empire</b>, Tesla studied engineering and 
                physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree, gaining practical experience in the early 
                1880s working in telephony and at <b>Continental Edison</b> in the new <b>electric power industry</b>.
                In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen.
                He worked for a short time at the <b>Edison Machine Works</b> in New York City before he struck out on his own.
                With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and
                companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices.
                His <b>alternating current (AC) induction motor </b>and related <b>polyphase</b> AC patents,
                licensed by <b>Westinghouse Electric</b> in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and
                became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.</p>

                <p>A Tesla coil is an electrical resonant transformer circuit designed by
                     inventor Nikola Tesla in 1891.It is used to produce high-voltage,
                     low-current, high-frequency alternating-current electricity.
                     Tesla experimented with a number of different configurations consisting of two,
                     or sometimes three, coupled resonant electric circuits.</p>

                 <h3 class="about1"> TESLA'S OSCILLATOR</h3>
                 <p>Tesla's oscillator is a reciprocating electricity generator. Steam 
                     would be forced into the oscillator, and exit through a series of ports,
                     pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an armature,
                     causing it to vibrate up and down at high speed, producing electricity.
                     The casing's upper chamber had to withstand pressures of 400 psi (2.8 MPa) and 
                     temperatures exceeding 200 °C. Some versions used air trapped behind 
                     the piston as an "air spring", increasing efficiency. Another variation
                     used electromagnets to control the frequency of the piston's oscillation.</p>

                <h3 class="about1">COLORADO SPRING</h3>
               <p>To further study the conductive nature of low-pressure air, Tesla set up an experimental station 
                 at high altitude in Colorado Springs during 1899.There he could safely operate 
                 much larger coils than in the cramped confines of his New York lab, and
                 an associate had made an arrangement for the El Paso Power Company to 
                 supply alternating current free of charge.To fund his experiments, he convinced
                 John Jacob Astor IV to invest $100,000 ($3,517,600 in today's dollars) to
                 become a majority shareholder in the Nikola Tesla Company. Astor thought
                 he was primarily investing in the new wireless lighting system. Instead,
                 Tesla used the money to fund his Colorado Springs experiments</p>

                <h3 class="about1">BLADELESS TURBINE</h3>
                <p>On his 50th birthday, in 1906, Tesla demonstrated a 200 horsepower (150 kilowatts) 16,000 rpm bladeless turbine.
                     During 1910–1911, at the Waterside Power Station in New York, several 
                     of his bladeless turbine engines were tested at 100–5,000 hp.Tesla worked with 
                     several companies including from 1919 to 1922 in Milwaukee, for Allis-Chalmers.
                     He spent most of his time trying to perfect the
                     Tesla turbine with Hans Dahlstrand, the head engineer at the company,
                     but engineering difficulties meant it was never made into a practical device</p>

                <li>“I do not think you can name many great inventions that have been made by married men.”</li>
                <li>“One must be sane to think clearly, but one can think deeply and be quite insane.”</li>
